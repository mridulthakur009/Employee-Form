I have to create an Employee form having Following fields:

Apply validation using JavaScript as follows:
1. First Name: length should be less than 10, should only contain characters, no special characters.
2. Last Name: length should be less than 10, should only contain characters, no special characters.
3. Mob. No: Must have length = 10, must be number.

Note.: Don't apply above mentioned validations using HTML.
